				<h1>Hey there! 👋 I'm Rohan Robinson</h1>
			</div>

			<div id="aboutMe">
				<p id="background">
					I'm a rising senior at Dartmouth College majoring in Computer Science. 💻 <br /> <br />
					I'm interested in using software and technology to solve problems in the world (I know it's cliche, but its the truth!). 😁 <br /> 
					Outside of learning to program well and completing my studies, I'm focused on improving my writing and poker decision making. 🎰 <br />  <br />
				</p>

				<p id="now">
					Right now I'm working on a team at DALI to develop PeerTECH, a tool that enables adults with serious mental illness how to co-manage psychiatric illness and chronic health conditions. We're using React/React-Native/Redux and Firebase to build this out. 
				</p>

				<p id="previous">
					During Winter of 2020 I worked on another DALI to build the new interface for the D-Plan app at Dartmouth. A student's D-Plan is their master schedule of which quarters they'll be on campus and which quarters they'll be off campus. <br /> <br />
					Before this project the UI was clunky, slow and not intuitive. Alongside a team of 2 other developers, 2 designers and a project manager we created a React app in partnership with technology staff at the College. 
					It'll be rolled out for all 4000+ students to use Fall 2020. <br /> <br />
					Before that I spent a summer working for Apergy/ChampionX, an oil and gas supplier co. in Houston where I became familiar with creating web pages, scripting to automate business analysis, and communicating across disciplines (usually between engineers and salespeople).
